Vault
=====

Vault is an encrypted disk image manager for Mac OS X. Using the `createVault.pl` script will create a new vault. Each vault must be given a unique password. After creating as many vaults as you wish, launch Vault.app to access your vaults. 

Enter the password for the Vault you want. The password is used on each vault, if the password works the given vault will be opened. If none of the vaults work, a picture is taken with the iSight camera and stored in the following directory:

	~/Library/Application Support/.fconfig/log

You may wish to setup different passwords for different levels of security. If questioned about Vault.app, you should consider entering a password for a vault that does not contain any real sensitive information.
